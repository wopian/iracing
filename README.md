# iRacing Settings

These settings are adjusted for the HTC Vive running on a GTX 970 and i7 2600k @ 4.2Ghz

If you don't use VR, you may still find some of the settings of use - do not copy the entirety of the files though

If you have a GTX 1080/better CPU you can likely adjust the render/replay settings to `MAX` and increase the `ResolutionScalePct` in `renderDX11.ini`
